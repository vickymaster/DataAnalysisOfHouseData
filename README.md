# DataAnalysisOfHouseData
Exploratory Data Analysis of apartments in Dublin City Centre which includes the price of an apartment and its details.

Initially data preprocessing is performed such as converting categorical variables into factors. Then extracting statistical summary and plotting the data using various data visualization techniques to identify hidden trends in data.

Another part of this project includes predicting price of an apartment using the predictor variable as Number of Bedrooms using Simple Linear Regression. I studied various model assumptions required for a good linear regression fit and checked whether these assumptions are satisfied in my fitted model. This was followed by performing Hypothesis testing and calculating confidence intervals of various estimated parameters.
